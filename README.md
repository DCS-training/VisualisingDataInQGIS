# Visualising Data In QGIS

This repository contains the material connected to a workshop developed for CDCS by Ian Holmes [Edina](https://edina.ac.uk/).
This workshop shows how to create these sorts of data visualisations with QGIS. It focuses on a rangeÂ of data visualisation plugins.

A core point dataset is manipulated in a range of ways along with backdrop mapping to produce interesting views of the data.

It also covers the process of creating point data from a csv file; overlaying it on an OpenStreetMap basemap; visualising it as a heatmap; using a hexagonal grid to sample the data; creating 3D skyscraper diagram of the hexagon; and visualising changes to the point distribution over time.

## Learning objectives: 

- To work with raster, vector and web basemaps within a GIS to visualise data.
- Create heatmap to visualise distribution of point data.
- Learn how to use the TimeManager plugin to view change over time.
- Learn how to create 3D visualisations in QGIS
